# System Architecture

## Frontend Architecture
- **Technology**: Vanilla JavaScript with TailwindCSS for styling
- **Structure**: Single-page application with dynamic content rendering
- **UI Components**: Control panel, content display area, and image gallery sidebar
- **Animation**: Custom canvas-based particle animation for visual appeal
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with RTL (right-to-left) support for Arabic

## Backend Architecture
- **Framework**: Flask (Python web framework)
- **Structure**: Simple REST API with service-oriented architecture
- **Services**: Modular design with separate services for research generation and image search
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive logging and graceful error responses

# Key Components

## Research Generation Service (`services/research_generator.py`)
- **Purpose**: Generates comprehensive research content using OpenAI's GPT models
- **Features**: 
  - Multi-language support (Arabic, English, French)
  - Structured research format with introduction, main sections, and conclusion
  - Markdown formatting for proper document structure
  - Image placeholder integration for visual content
  - **Enhanced Translation System**: Gemini AI-powered topic translation with comprehensive fallback dictionary
  - **Name Recognition**: Smart detection and transliteration of Arabic names (e.g., "أسماء بوجيبار" → "Asma Boujibar")

## Image Search Service (`services/image_search.py`)
- **Purpose**: Searches and retrieves relevant images for research topics
- **Technology**: DuckDuckGo Search API for image retrieval
- **Features**:
  - Image accessibility verification
  - Metadata extraction (dimensions, source, title)
  - Safe search filtering
  - Result processing and optimization
  - **Enhanced Feature**: Always attempts to fetch 20 images using multiple search strategies
  - **Smart Retry**: Uses different image sizes (medium/large/small) across attempts
  - **Duplicate Prevention**: Automatically filters out duplicate image URLs

## Frontend Components
- **Main Interface**: Dynamic content rendering with language switching
- **Background Animation**: Canvas-based particle system for visual enhancement
- **PDF Export**: Client-side PDF generation using html2pdf.js
- **Image Integration**: Drag-and-drop image placement into research content
- **Translate Button**: In-field translation button that translates user input to selected language before research generation

# Data Flow

1. **User Input**: User enters research topic and selects language
2. **Research Generation**: 
   - Frontend sends topic and language to `/api/generate-research`
   - Backend calls OpenAI API with language-specific prompts
   - Generated content is returned and rendered as Markdown
3. **Image Search**:
   - System automatically searches for relevant images
   - Images are fetched via `/api/search-images` endpoint
   - Results are displayed in sidebar gallery
4. **Content Assembly**: Users can insert images into research placeholders
5. **Export**: Final document can be exported as PDF

# External Dependencies

## APIs and Services
- **OpenAI API**: Content generation using GPT models
- **DuckDuckGo Search**: Image search and retrieval
- **Required Environment Variables**:
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API authentication
  - `SESSION_SECRET`: Flask session security (optional, has default)

## Frontend Libraries
- **TailwindCSS**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **Marked.js**: Markdown to HTML conversion

# Deployment Strategy

## Development Setup
- **Entry Point**: `main.py` starts the Flask development server
- **Configuration**: Environment-based configuration for API keys
- **Debug Mode**: Enabled for development with detailed error logging

## Production Considerations
- **Security**: Session secret configuration required
- **Logging**: Structured logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user-friendly error messages
- **Rate Limiting**: Should be implemented for API endpoints in production
